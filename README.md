# ScoreKeeper
Project #2 for Udacity - Google Developer Challange Scholarship - Android Basics

The app lets you select home and away teams from a spinner listing the 20 participants in La Liga 2017-2018 season 
(main spanish soccer league).
When selecting teams, the logos coresponding to the selected teams are updated automatically.
Using the app, one can keep track of the goal score, the number of fouls, yellow cards and red cards in the game.

When the game is finished, you can use the "Reset" button to reset the counters and eventually select other teams.

Please feel free to suggest improvements to the code and/or the design.
Thank you !
